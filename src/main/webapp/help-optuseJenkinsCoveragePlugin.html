   <h3>Information about Jenkins Coverage Plugin</a></h3>
   <table>
      <tr>
         The <a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/coverage/">Jenkins Coverage Plugin</a> publishes a report of the code and mutation coverage in your build, so you can navigate to a summary report from the main build page. Additionally, the plugin gathers several metrics (lines of code, cyclomatic complexity, number of tests per class) and visualizes these results along with the coverage information. 
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <p>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         From there you can also dive into the details:
         <ul>
            <li>Tree charts that show the distribution of the metrics by type (line, branch, complexity, tests, etc.)
            <li>Tabular listing of all files with their coverage, complexity and number of tests
            <li>Source code of the files with the coverage highlighted
            <li>Trend charts of the coverage over time
         </ul>
      </tr>

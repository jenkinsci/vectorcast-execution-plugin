<div>
    The use case for this option is when another Pipeline job wants call the VectorCAST pipeline job and has checked out the VectorCAST Project.  This options sets up the following parameters to be passed in from another Pipeline Job.
<ul>
  <li>VCAST_PROJECT_DIR - Predetermined location of the VectorCAST Project that is passed in.  When using this option do not specify a fully qualified path name to the VectorCAST Project</li>
  <li>VCAST_FORCE_NODE_EXEC_NAME - Forces VectorCAST Jobs to be run on a specific node instead of a node with a label matching the compiler</li>
</ul>

The two parameters can be used independently.  If you are using VCAST_PROJECT_DIR to specify an external VectorCAST Project, please ensure that any setup/tear down script is properly setup. For example, if a setenv.bat is in the external repository, you can prefixed the script as follows:
<pre>
    call ${VCAST_PROJECT_DIR}\setenv.bat
</pre>


Syntax of what a calling job may use to call a parameterized VectorCAST Pipeline job
<pre>
catchError(buildResult: 'SUCCESS', stageResult: 'FAILURE', catchInterruptions : false ) {
   build job: 'UnitTestingProject_vcast_pipeline', 
    parameters: [string(name: 'VCAST_PROJECT_DIR',          value: 'C:\\UnitTesting\\Project'), 
                 string(name: 'VCAST_FORCE_NODE_EXEC_NAME', value: 'MyTestNode')]
}

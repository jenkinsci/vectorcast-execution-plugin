        This legacy plugin allows you to capture code coverage reports from VectorCAST Projects. Jenkins will generate the trend report of coverage. This plugin is used automatically with the <a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/vectorcast-execution/">VectorCAST Execution Plugin</a>
<p>
        Coverage information from tests runs that has been converted to XML files is read and displayed by this plugin. It shows coverage trends and allows drilling down to more detailed coverage information

         <ul>
            <li>Tree charts that show the distribution of the metrics by type (line, branch, MC/DC Pairs, Function Coverage, etc.)
            <li>Tabular listing of all environments/files with their coverage and complexity
            <li>Trend charts of the coverage over time
         </ul>
      </tr>

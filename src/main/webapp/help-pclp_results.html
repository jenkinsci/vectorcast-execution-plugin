        A pattern is defined by an <a href="https://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/fileset.html">Ant Fileset ''includes''</a>
        setting that specifies the report files to scan for issues. Multiple patterns can be separated by space or comma.
        Note that such a pattern is resolved in Jenkins' workspace, so the paths must be relative only.
        <p>
        If no pattern is specified then the build's console text will be scanned instead.

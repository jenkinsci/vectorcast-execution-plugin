Create, delete and update Jobs for
[VectorCAST](http://vector.com/vectorcast)/Manage
projects.

# Summary

This plugin allows the user to create, delete and update Jobs to build
and run
[VectorCAST](http://vector.com/vectorcast) projects.
Coverage is displayed using the [VectorCAST Coverage
Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/VectorCAST+Coverage+Plugin).

Jobs can be created as a single job or split into multiple jobs for a
Manage project, with one job for each environment and an overall job to
combine the results.

# Usage

This plugin adds a new top-level menu item to the Jenkins sidebar.

![](docs/images/vc_menu_in_sidebar.png)

that provides job control for
[VectorCAST](http://vector.com/vectorcast)/Manage projects

![](docs/images/image2017-10-17_18_14_2.png)

## Job Types

There are 2 types of supported jobs and 1 deprecated job type

-   **Single Job**
-   **Pipeline Job**
-   **Multi-Job (Deprecated)**

### Single Job

**Single** creates a single Jenkins job to build/execute and
(optionally) report on all environments in a VectorCAST/Manage project.

![](docs/images/single.png)

### Pipeline Job

**Pipeline** creates a Jenkins Pipeline job to build/execute and
(optionally) report on all environments in a VectorCAST/Manage project
in parallel.

:warning:*Pipeline jobs require VectorCAST 2018 as a minimum version and VectorCAST 2019SP3 to perform parallel execution on a single VectorCAST Project*

![](docs/images/pipeline_create.png)

There are 2 options for running tests
- Use an SCM system (any that is supported by Jenkins)
    -   In this case, Jenkins will check out the code and tests into the
        workspace for each Jenkins job from your repository
    -   The pipeline job will them combine the coverage and test
        results from all these individual machines/nodes
    -   In this case, the VectorCAST/Manage project should be specified
        as relative to the root of the checkout
    - There is now an option to use the main Pipeline Job's Workspace as 
        a dedicated single checkout directory.  This checkout directory must be available
        to all executors across all nodes either by having all executors running on the same
        computer or have the main Pipeline Job's Workspace on a shared network drive.
- Use an existing drive/directory for VectorCAST/Manage project
    -   In this case, the VectorCAST/Manage project should be specified
        as an absolute path that is available on all machines/nodes
    -   Each job can optionally clean up the working directory which
        will have no effect on the VectorCAST/Manage project since it is
        located elsewhere
    -   The reports are generated into the workspace and archived as
        part of the Jenkins job
 
The user will be able to disable the use of Change Based Testing to perform a 
complete run of their VectorCAST Project.  By default Change Based Testing is enabled, but 
this option can be disabled by unchecking the Use Change Based Testing box

For users with Continuous Integration Licenses, you will be able to access those licenses by
checking the Use Continuous Integration License checkbox.  If you do not have 
Continuous Integration Licenses, do not check this box as you will encounter licensing errors.

If the user wishes to call the Jenkins job from another Pipeline job, check the box to 
parameterize the Jenkinsfile.  This will add parameters to the pipeline job  
that will be used by the VectorCAST pipeline job to locate the VectorCAST/Manage project (VCAST_PROJECT_DIR)
and for forcing the VectorCAST Jobs to be executed on a specific node (VCAST_FORCE_NODE_EXEC_NAME) instead of using 
the compiler as a node label.

Calling the build command will return Failed, Unstable, Success corresponding to the results of the VectorCAST
Pipeline job.  To enabled the main pipeline job to continue, the user can surround the build command without
a _catchError_ block as demonstrated below

```
catchError(buildResult: 'SUCCESS', stageResult: 'FAILURE', catchInterruptions : false ) {
   build job: 'UnitTestingProject_vcast_pipeline', parameters: [string(name: 'VCAST_PROJECT_DIR', value: 'C:\\UnitTesting\\Project'), string(name: 'VCAST_FORCE_NODE_EXEC_NAME', value: 'MyTestNode')]
}
```

Additionally, if a shared artifact directory is specified, VectorCAST/Manage
will execute jobs independently, but have a central location for storing
the build artifacts.  This option can be used to accelerate testing by use
of VectorCAST's Change Based Testing feature. 

For Pipeline jobs, the plugin processes the build log to determine which
tests have been skipped by VectorCAST's Change Based Testing feature.  Any
test cases that had previously pass and were skipped on the current execution
will be marked as skipped for JUnit and display as such in yellow on the test result
trend chart:

![](docs/images/test_trends.png)

and denoted as _Skipped_ in the test results list

![](docs/images/test_results.png)

        
### Multi-Job (Deprecated)

**Multi-Job (Deprecated)** creates a top-level Jenkins job to combine the results from
individual Jenkins jobs created for each environment in the
VectorCAST/Manage project. The options for a multi-job are the same as
single apart from supplying a copy of the Manage project.

![](docs/images/image2017-10-25_17_3_35.png)

Jenkins jobs normally build and run in independent workspaces. This is
the case with this integration. However, there are 2 options for running
tests

-   Use an SCM system (any that is supported by Jenkins)
    -   In this case, Jenkins will check out the code and tests into the
        workspace for each Jenkins job from your repository
    -   The top-level job will them combine the coverage and test
        results from all these individual machines/nodes
    -   In this case, the VectorCAST/Manage project should be specified
        as relative to the root of the checkout
    -   Each job can optionally clean up the working directory. If the
        working directory is not cleaned, then the results from the
        previous run allow VectorCAST/Manage to optimize the execution
        phase based on any code changes
-   Use a common, shared drive/directory
    -   In this case, the VectorCAST/Manage project should be specified
        as an absolute path that is available on all machines/nodes
    -   Note: Some network drives/shares do not fully implement file
        locking which cause SQLite, used by VectorCAST/Manage, problems
        that can result in corruption of the results. If this happens,
        you may need to use a different network drive/share or consider
        using an SCM system. Using VectorCAST vc2019 SP3 eliminates these 
        errors
    -   Each job can optionally clean up the working directory which
        will have no effect on the VectorCAST/Manage project since it is
        located elsewhere
    -   The reports are generated into the workspace and archived as
        part of the Jenkins job

## Controlling Where Jobs Run

When using Multi-Jobs, the jobs are created to run on specific nodes
related to the compiler chosen for the environment. E.g.

![](docs/images/restrict.png)

Make sure to set the labels on the relevant Jenkins nodes. Manage
Jenkins -\> Manage Nodes -\> configure appropriate node and set the
‘Labels’ field. In this example the labels have been set to
GNU\_Native\_5.1\_C and GNU\_Native\_4.8\_C

![](docs/images/restrict_node.png)

## Setup/Configuration

The requirements for using this plugin with VectorCAST are

-   VectorCAST needs to be installed and setup on each node to be used
    -   VECTORCAST\_DIR and VECTOR\_LICENSE needs to be set correctly
-   Jenkins needs to be installed and setup
    -   in particular BUILD\_URL needs to be defined (in
        Jenkins-\>Manage Jenkins-\>Configure System and define 'Jenkins
        URL' and save the settings

## Updating Existing Multi-job (Deprecated)

An existing multi-job can be updated using the Update Multi-job setup
manually, or by creating an auto-update multi-job Job. The auto-update
job may require username/password to be supplied depending on your
Jenkins configuration.

## Known Issues

### VectorCAST Reports and Jenkins Content Security Policy

VectorCAST HTML reports for metrics were updated to use cascading style 
sheets (CSS) in the 2019 release and 2020 for top level project metrics. This 
was done to give users more flexibility in what and how metrics are 
displayed.  To maintain single file HTML format, VectorCAST Reports used inline 
CSS.  Inline CSS was disallowed under Jenkins more restrictive CSP.

"Jenkins 1.641 / Jenkins 1.625.3 introduce
the `Content-Security-Policy` header to static files served by Jenkins
(specifically, `DirectoryBrowserSupport`). This header is set to a very
restrictive default set of permissions to protect Jenkins users from
malicious HTML/JS files in workspaces, `/userContent`, or archived
artifacts."

The result of this combination incorrectly formatted the VectorCAST reports.

Numerous options are available to correct this:
- Use the Jenkins Resource Root URL (Manage Jenkins > Configure System)
- Reconfigure VectorCAST Jobs to use external CSS (VCAST_RPTS_SELF_CONTAINED=FALSE)
combined with enabling anonymous reads from the Manage Jenkins > Configure Global Security > Authorization
- Reconfigure the Jenkins Content Security Policy
- Download the archives and view reports locally

For more information on the Jenkins CSP, please see [Configuring Content Security
Policy](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Configuring+Content+Security+Policy)

### JUnit publisher failing environment with no test cases

For non-pipeline jobs, JUnit publisher will fail any environments published 
with no test results. If you have an environment with no test results, 
you will manually need to check the box "Do not fail the build on empty test
results" in the Publish JUnit test result report configuration.
